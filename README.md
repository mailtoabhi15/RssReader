This Project is part of AND Project on Material Design and thus uses the skeleton code from the provided material in the cource @ Udacity

##Project Overview
In this project, We will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.
This project will give us an opportunity to improve an app design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating 
and changing an app design as new standards are released.

##This project will help us in understanding:

*The fundamentals of Android design.

*Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.

*Separate an interface into surfaces.

*Effectively use transitions and motion.
